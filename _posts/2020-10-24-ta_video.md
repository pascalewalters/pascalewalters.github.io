title: Teaching Assistant Lab Prep Videos
---

This term, I'm a teaching assistant for BME 121: Digital Computation. My role for this course, beyond office hours and assignment marking, has been making lab prep videos. Instead of tutorials this term, these lab prep videos are meant to provide the students with some coding examples that can hopefully help them with the lab activities.
