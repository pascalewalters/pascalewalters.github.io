Hey! I'm Pascale.

I'm an MASc candidate in the Vision and Image Processing Lab at the University of Waterloo. My current research is around camera calibration and computer vision techniques for sports analytics.

In my spare time, I like to play hockey 🏒, field hockey 🏑, run 🏃‍♀️, ski 🎿, cook 👩‍🍳, and read 📚.
